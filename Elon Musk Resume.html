            Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal),
            SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company,
            Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.

        <h2><p style="text-align:left;">Education</p></h2>
        <strong><i>At age 17,</i></strong> in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military.
    Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.
    <h2><p><strong>Companies</p></strong><p></h2>
    Companies
    Zip2 Corporation
    Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.

    PayPal
    In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal as it is known today.

    In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.

    SpaceX
    Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle missions.
